<h2>HYDRAULIC GRADIENT AND TOTAL ENERGY LINE </h2>

The concept of hydraulic gradient line and total energy line is very useful in the study of flow of fluids through pipes. They are defined as : <br>

<b>Hydraulic Gradient Line</b>: It is defined as the line which gives the sum of pressure head (p/w) and datum head (z) of a flowing fluid in a pipe with respect to some reference line or it is the line which is obtained by joining the top of all vertical ordinates, showing the pressure head (p/w) of a flowing fluid in a pipe from the centre of the pipe. It is briefly written as H.G.L. (Hydraulic Gradient Line). <br>

<b>Total Energy Line</b>: It is defined as the line which gives the sum of pressure head, datum head and kinetic head of a flowing fluid in a pipe with respect to some reference line. It is also defined as the line which is obtained by joining the tops of all vertical ordinates showing the sum of pressure head and kinetic head from the centre of the pipe. It is briefly written as T.E.L. (Total Energy Line).
